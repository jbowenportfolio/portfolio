        <h2>How I Came to Love Nature</h2>
        <p>I remember that before I ever chose to devote my time to nature, I read a book. I distinctly remember that October afternoon, sitting in Mr. Graff’s class. My leg bounced with anticipation, sending shock waves of energy through my calf up to my femur and through my spine before clattering loudly in my brain as thoughts of leaving –thoughts of going home. My eyes nearly burning from having forced them open all day, screaming in my soul to just let myself sleep. Restless to be done with this class. Environmental literature being an elective that I had not elected to take, being forced by the administration onto my schedule for need of more credits. I kept myself quiet as we were told that we would be starting a new book that day, but inside my heart rang out in a cacophonous groan of protest. I stared down at the softcover book laying on my desk before me. The stark white visage of a polar bear gazed back, her eyes dark and pensive. A wise beast from the far north. Power and mystique adorn her spirit. I opened past the cover, reading the foreword, the acknowledgments, and the dedication. The book was apparently dedicated to the author’s daughter. I wondered if I would ever have a child of my own. “Probably not.” I thought to myself. This world is too tumultuous to ever hope to raise a kid who wasn’t at least a little bit damaged. That thought of fear of impending ecological collapse whispered constantly in the back of my brain ever since I was old enough to know that the world was in failing hands. Pale, wrinkled hands that would rather spend their time hoarding power and wealth, leaving commoners cast to the wayside. As I began to read, I learned that the author shared my thoughts on the matter. He was writing this book as a sort of catalog, or perhaps a tribute would be more accurate. The book detailed the accounts of environmental scientists who were each working to save a specific species from extinction. And, to my surprise, in spite of my previous boredom, I found myself engrossed in these people’s stories. It was heartening to know that despite the obvious despair to be found in the world’s present situation, at least somebody was trying to do something, anything to amend the damage done.
 I found myself leaving class that afternoon with a sense of ambition. A sense of hope, and some sense of belief. Not a belief in the structures of the world that had thrown us into this mess, but in myself and others. In the potential that exists to make the world better. When I got home that day, instead of walking inside, I went to the forest behind my house. I found myself in a great expanse of verdant spires. Evergreen skyscrapers with their perennial apartments. Bustling lives of squirrels and woodpeckers, bumblebees and wasps, crows and coyotes. Animated features of meandering streams contrasting with static features of moss-laden boulders. Soft carpets of clover blossoms form a comfortable bed of green for the creatures who called this city home. I know that I want to help this place. It is my hope that with my hands, I may bring peace to the pain; save it from the destruction that has been wrought by human hands.
